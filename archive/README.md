These phase completion documents were moved to archive to:
1. Keep the root directory clean and focused
2. Maintain historical context for reference
3. Separate completed phase docs from active development docs
4. Preserve implementation history

## 📝 Note

These documents are kept for historical reference and should not be modified. For current project status, refer to the implementation plan:
